The Plan
========

On Tuesday 12 November 2019 the scope of this study was redefined to
look just at a year's worth of inbound traffic on the section of Milton
Road between the A14 junction and its junction with Elizabeth Road
during the morning peak (defined to be 07:30-09:30) Monday to Friday.

This corresponds to Drakewell links '36 Milton InB \*\*'
(CAMBRIDGE_JTMS|9800X7003HZY) and '12 Milton Rd InB \*'
(CAMBRIDGE_JTMS|9800YU0FYRKZ) and a new SmartCambridge zone
'milton_road_alternate_in'.
